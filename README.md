- :smile: I'm Anh (Jessie) Nguyen, I'm a junior student pursuing a B.S in Computer Science at University of Rochester :woman_technologist:

- :star_struck: I am interested in Open Source, Software Development and Engineering. Summer 2020, I contributed to Facebookâ€™s **React Native** project as part of the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). I worked on React Native Hermes Sampling Profiler, which is towards the goal to visualize the performance of JavaScript running on Hermes in a React Native app. You can find here the [Pull Request](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/1246) I made on the React Native CLI repository :partying_face:

- :sunglasses: Aside from this, I'm developing an OSS tool for stacked Pull Requests with three other friends. The tool is [Stack-Attack](https://github.com/taneliang/stack-attack), which started from a small project in a hackathon. We decided to continue the project after the hackathon as a lot of people were interested in using the tool. Thus, my teammates and I have been working hard and expect to ship the tool in soon :rocket:

- :star: Iâ€™m looking for Summer 2021 internship opportunities in Software development and engineering :raising_hand:. Iâ€™m interested in solving problems and building software that impact people around me :raised_hands:
