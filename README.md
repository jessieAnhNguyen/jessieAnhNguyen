- :smile:  I'm Anh (Jessie) Nguyen, I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Rochester :woman_technologist:

- :star_struck:  I am interested in Open Source, Software Development and Engineering. Summer 2020, I contributed to Facebookâ€™s **React Native** project as part of the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). I worked on **React Native Hermes Sampling Profiler**, which is towards the goal to visualize the performance of JavaScript running on Hermes in a React Native app. You can find here the [Pull Request](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/1246) I made on the React Native CLI repository :partying_face: Check out this [article](https://www.g2i.co/blog/profiling-react-native-apps-runtime-performance-using-hermes) that my teammate and I wrote about that Hermes and React Native project!

- :sunglasses:  Aside from this, I'm developing an OSS tool for **stacked Pull Requests** on GitHub with three other friends. The tool is [Stack-Attack](https://github.com/taneliang/stack-attack), which started from a small project that was the winner of the MLH Halfway hackathon. We decided to continue after the hackathon as a lot of people were interested in using the tool. Thus, my teammates and I have been working hard and expect to ship Stack-Attack soon :rocket:

- :star:  Iâ€™m looking for **Software engineering internship opportunities** :raising_hand:. Iâ€™m interested in solving problems and building software that impact people around me :raised_hands:
