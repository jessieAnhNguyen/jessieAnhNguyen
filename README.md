I'm Anh (Jessie) Nguyen, I'm a junior student pursuing a B.S in Computer Science at University of Rochester :woman_technologist:

I am interested in Open Source, Software Development and Engineering. Summer 2020, I contributed to Facebookâ€™s **React Native** project as part of the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). This is the [Pull Request](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/1246) I made on the React Native CLI repository.

Aside from this, I built an OSS tool for stacked Pull Requests with three other friends. The tool is [Stack-Attack](https://github.com/taneliang/stack-attack), which started from a small project that my teammates and I worked on for a hackathon. We've been working hard and expect to ship the tool in 1-2 weeks :rocket:

Iâ€™m looking for Summer 2021 internship opportunities in Software development and engineering. Iâ€™m interested in solving problems and building software that impact people around me :raised_hands:
